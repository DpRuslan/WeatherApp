In the additional task, it was said to do localization in two languages,
English and Ukrainian, but after re-reading all the API documentation,
it turned out that it supports multiple languages,
but there is only one key that it translates in different languages, and it is - 'condition:text'.
Therefore, I implemented an additional task in such a way that I localized
all strings except the city that is displayed (eng.) and it must be entered
in the city search in English.
Because the api does not support search and result in multilanguage.
